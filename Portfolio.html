            <h3>Vehicle theft intimation alarm system</h3>
            <p>A vehicle theft intimation alarm system is a security device designed to alert the owner or authorities if an unauthorized attempt is made to access or steal a vehicle. The system typically includes sensors placed strategically throughout the vehicle to detect unauthorized entry, movement, or tampering. When triggered, the alarm emits loud audible sounds and may also activate flashing lights to deter thieves and attract attention. Additionally, modern systems may integrate with smartphone apps or GPS tracking technology to provide real-time alerts and location tracking in case of theft.</p>
        <h3>Automatic street light controller</h3>
        <P>An automatic street light controller is a device or system designed to control the operation of street lights based on environmental conditions such as darkness or daylight. It typically includes sensors to detect ambient light levels and a control unit to adjust the intensity or turn on/off the street lights accordingly. The controller may employ technologies such as photocells, infrared sensors, or motion detectors to determine when illumination is necessary, optimizing energy efficiency and enhancing safety on roads and streets.</P>
